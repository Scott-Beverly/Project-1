			<h3>About me </h3>
			<p>I am a front-end developer who enjoys turning creative ideas into reality. Having motivation and a driven mindset are two aspects that I hold proud to my name. One of the things I consider most important in my life is my family. I feel informing Loved ones of your ideas is a great way to maintain focus and maintain motivation moving forward. For a long time, I worked for a company I never really enjoyed. Day after day was the same feeling, unhappiness, disappointment and no motivation. After several years, and the support of my family I finally decided that I needed a change. What I finally learned for myself is that you can make all the money in the world but if you do not love what you do, you will never be happy. </p>

			<h3>Career Goals</h3>
			<P>One of the first major career goals I made more myself was when I committed myself to General Assembly for this software engineering course. My current goal is to complete this course with obtaining as much information as I possibly can, so when it comes time to take my knowledge to the work force, I am a valued member of a team pursuing what they also love to do, helping make my dreams and otherâ€™s visions into a reality. Eventually with time, hard work and enough experience, I would love to be the lead software engineer of a renowned company or to branch off and create a name for myself with my own web developing business. </P>
